## Christian Pratt

I am currently a fourth year physics PhD student in the [Complexity Sciences Center](https://csc.ucdavis.edu) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). Previously, I recieved my BSc and MS degrees in physics from UC Davis, and before that I recieved my AA in mathematics from the [SDCCD](https://www.sdccd.edu).

### Research

I am interested in the physics of computation, and understanding the relationship between energy and information. Currently, I am using dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics to make sense of the fundamental physics of computing. 

#### Papers

Here are my papers
