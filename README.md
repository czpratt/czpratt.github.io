## Christian Pratt

I am currently a fourth year physics PhD student in the [Complexity Sciences Center](https://csc.ucdavis.edu) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). Previously, I recieved my BSc and MS degrees in physics from UC Davis, and before that I recieved my AA in mathematics from the [SDCCD](https://www.sdccd.edu).

Broadly, I am interested in all things computational.

### Research

What is the fundamental physics of computation? I am using tools from dynamical systems theory and thermodynamics to help make sense of this question. Specifically, I am using superconducting circuits as a test-bed for exploring the physics of information storage and processing.
