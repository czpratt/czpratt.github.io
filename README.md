## Christian Pratt

I am currently a fourth year physics PhD student in the [Complexity Sciences Center](https://csc.ucdavis.edu) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). Previously, I recieved my BSc and MS degrees in physics from UC Davis, and before that I recieved my AA in mathematics from the [SDCCD](https://www.sdccd.edu).

### Research

What is energy? What is information? What is their relationship, and how can we leverage it? Studying the physics of computation is one way of understanding this connection. Currently, I am using dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics to understand how computations are performed at a fundamental level. Specifically, we are leveraging superconducting devices as a test bed for exploring this paradigm of computing.
