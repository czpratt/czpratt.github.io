## Christian Pratt

I am currently a fourth year physics PhD student in the [Complexity Sciences Center](https://csc.ucdavis.edu) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu). Broadly, I am interested in all things computational.

### Research

What is the fundamental physics of computation? I am using tools from dynamical systems theory, statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium thermodynamics to help make sense of this question. Specifically, I am using potential energy landscapes that are generated by superconducting circuits as a test-bed for exploring the physics of information storage and processing.
